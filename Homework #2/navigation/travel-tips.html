    <h2>Here are our best Travel Tips</h2>

    <h3>Consider Your Clothing</h3>
    You don’t have to dress nicely by any means, but you should probably follow a couple of basic rules. Most
    importantly, don’t ever consider fanny packs/bum bags. Not under any circumstances. They are easy to rob, mark you
    as a tourist, and most damning of all – they are incredibly ugly.For North Americans, leave behind the white socks,
    white sneakers, and baseball cap as well. It’s certainly okay to keep your own sense of style, but if you want
    people to treat you more fairly, then avoiding the stereotypes is a good idea.</p>

    <h3>2. Money Matters</h3>
    <p>How much cash should you take and in what form? The simplest approach is to forget the traveler’s checks and
        large wads of cash. Instead, bring your ATM card and pull out your money as you need it. </p>
    <p>Try to withdraw the equivalent of a couple hundred at a time–this way you don’t pay a fortune in transaction
        fees, but if you lose your cash or are robbed it’s not the end of the world. Most cities and almost all airports
        are connected these days. One of the best travel tips for beginners is if you are going to be in an airport or
        passing through one, you should be just fine with withdrawing money.</p>

    <h3>3. Meet The Locals</h3>
    <p>Whether you’re staying in the poshest hotels or the hostel (check out our guide on staying at a hostel) with your
        roommates humping on the bunk above your head, you can meet other like-minded people more easily while
        traveling. This is one of the joys of traveling. But it’s always a good idea to get off the beaten path,
        especially if your trip is going to be longer than a month. There can be a language barrier, but you’ll be
        surprised how much information grunts and pantomimes can convey. Meeting locals will only enhance your travel
        experience. A good way to do this is either through a site such as couchsurfing.org, or wandering into
        non-touristy areas and just exploring. There are so many incredible benefits of learning a new language before
        you travel. Not only does it make getting around much easier, but it enriches your travel experience by allowing
        you to interact with more locals. Why not start practicing your language skills by signing up with Babbel?</p>
